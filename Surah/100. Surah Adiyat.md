# 100:2 فَٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ قَدْحًا

This is describing the horses going to the battle of Badr crediting it to Ibn Abas and Hasan.  Also note that this was revealed before the Battle of Badr. This could also describe the camels going to pilgrimage, however this imagery followed this eliminated this possibility. 

The word العديات has root words ع د و. These words typically signify **aggressive movement to cross the line**: to steal, kidnap, to bring back for judgment. This is talking about the initial cavalry that is small to deceive the enemy. The word is an اسم فاعل  which means that they've been going at it for a while. 

The ف means "therefore." Here. it is saying that because of the horses, causing sparks to fly.  There is an Arabic idiom saying قدْحٌ لا يٌرِي , this means sparks that never fly, like, you met someone and the sparks didn't go off. Allah has now reversed the order. These sparks are so intense that they're almost about to set fire.

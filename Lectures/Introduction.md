#### Comparison previous and last Revelation
- All previous revelations were sent to a particular group of people, but Qur'an was sent to whole human being.
- Qur'an is a **preserved book** by Allah.
- Qur'an was sent gradually through the life of Prophet SAW.
- The laws in the Qur'an was the last thing that was sent down by Allah.
#### Why was the Qur'an revealed over 23 years?
- It was revelated through the circumstances and give a solution to it. This helps purify a nation.
- This means we can go back to Qur'an and **relevant** to our circumstances and events.
- Qur'an came to reveal the misconceptions and doubts.
- Reduce the burden of understanding and following the rules, but focus on their belief(what is in their hearts.)
- When Muslims are weak, we can derive a lot of wisdom from the Mecca period and similar for Medina.

> The Prophet SAW used to pray around the Kabbah where there were idols around it. He knew that the idols were NOT the problem but its their belief(their hearts.) So, after 20 years he was able to destroy them - after conquering Mecca.
